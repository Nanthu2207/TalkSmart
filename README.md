# TalkSmart

TalkSmart is a conversational AI application that uses speech-to-text, a large language model (LLM), and text-to-speech technologies to create a seamless user experience. The application allows users to interact with a chatbot through voice commands, converting their speech into text, processing it using a language model, and responding back with audio.

## Features

- **Speech-to-Text**: Convert user speech to text using state-of-the-art speech recognition models.
- **AI Responses**: Use a large language model (LLM) to generate human-like responses based on the user's input.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Convert the chatbot's response back to audio, creating a natural, voice-based interaction.
- **User Interface**: Built with Gradio, allowing users to interact with the application directly through the web.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for development.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For language translation.
- **Gradio**: For building the user interface.
- **Flask/Streamlit**: Backend framework (optional).
- **Git**: For version control.
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: For deployment.
