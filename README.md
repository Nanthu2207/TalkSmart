# Speech-to-Speech Translation Bot

This project is a **Speech-to-Speech Translation Bot** that converts spoken language into another spoken language using advanced speech recognition and translation technologies. It is deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces**, providing an interactive platform for seamless communication across languages.

## Features
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken words into text.
- **Translation**: Translates text from one language to another.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Converts translated text back into speech.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for easy access and use.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for development.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For language translation.
- **Gradio**: For building the user interface.
- **Flask/Streamlit**: Backend framework (optional).
- **Git**: For version control.
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: For deployment.
